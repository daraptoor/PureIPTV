- **Immersive Channels Mode**: Toggle off all UI controls (search, filters, layout switches) with a single tap for a clean, edge-to-edge channel grid.
- **Smart Sticky Header**: The "Watch Now" header intelligently sticks to the top during browsing but detaches when a video is active to maximize screen real estate.
- **Compact Global Player**: A refined, low-profile player interface that provides essential info and EPG data without obstructing the view.
